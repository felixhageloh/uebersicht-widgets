# Widgets for [Ãœbersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/)

> UPDATE: widgets now live in their own github repo. The old format is still supported, but will be phased out soon.

Got a widget to share? Great, create a **github repo** for it, then [open an issue here](https://github.com/felixhageloh/uebersicht-widgets/issues) and be sure to mention the url.
It will get picked up ASAP!

## Widget format

Your repo should contain at least these three files:

* `widget.json` a widget manifest
* `<widget-name>.widget.zip` a zip archive containing your widget
* `screenshot.png` an image showing your widget in action

It is also advised that you include an unzipped version of your widget, so that people can view the code and/or issue pull requests with improvements.

### widget.json

A small manifest file that describes your widget. It should have the following format:

    {
      "name": "name of your widget",
      "description": "a short(!) description",
      "author": "your name",
      "email": "your email address"
    }

### widget-name.widget.zip

This is the actual widget, which is a zipped folder with the name of your widget and a .widget extension. The contents of the folder are usually just the .js or .coffee file with your widget code (you can call it anything you like, but index.js/.coffee seems like a good choice). If your widget needs any other assets such as images, fonts or even binaries, you can include them here.


### screenshot

> IMPORTANT: make sure your screen shot is 258x160px (516x320px for hi-res). Otherwise it will get scaled, squashed and/or squeezed in the widgets gallery.

An image file in any web format you like, showing a screen shot of your widget. Currently, screen shots are displayed at 258x160px. For best results you can provide a 516x320px image for retina resolution.

#### Still have questions? You can start by checking existing widgets for examples.
